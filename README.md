## My journey with Rust
This is my journey in learning rust.

The code will look horrible to experienced rust developers, and rightfully so.

I've decided to tackle Advent of Code 2022 as a way to learn a new programming language and my background is with languages like Java, C++, Python, and rust is clearly different from all of them, to the point that I need to switch my mindset completely if I want to go anywhere near the basic understanding of the potential of the language and be able to write sensible and readable rust code.
